                    <div class="description">
                        Pull-ups are a bodyweight exercise that strengthens the back, biceps, and core. They can be performed with different grips (wide, close, neutral) to target various muscles. Proper form includes engaging the core, pulling the chest toward the bar, and controlling the descent to maximize strength gains.

For muscle growth and endurance, consume high-protein foods like chicken, fish, eggs, and legumes. Carbohydrates from oats, rice, and fruits provide energy, while healthy fats from avocados and nuts aid recovery. Stay hydrated, and consider whey protein, creatine, and BCAAs for improved performance and muscle repair.

                        Squats are a compound exercise that targets the legs, glutes, and core, improving strength and mobility. Variations include bodyweight, barbell, goblet, and sumo squats. Proper form involves keeping the chest up, engaging the core, and lowering the hips until thighs are parallel to the ground before driving up through the heels.

                        For strength and muscle growth, eat high-protein foods like eggs, lean meats, and legumes. Carbohydrates from rice, potatoes, and fruits provide energy, while healthy fats from nuts and olive oil aid recovery. Stay hydrated, and consider whey protein, creatine, and electrolytes to enhance performance and muscle repair.

It can be performed with a barbell or dumbbells, using variations like flat, incline, or decline bench press to target different muscle angles. Proper form includes keeping feet planted, engaging the core, and lowering the bar to the mid-chest before pressing up.

For muscle growth and strength, consume high-protein foods like chicken, fish, eggs, and dairy. Carbohydrates from rice, oats, and fruits provide workout energy, while healthy fats from nuts and avocados support recovery. Stay hydrated, and consider whey protein, creatine, and BCAAs for enhanced performance. A balanced post-workout meal aids muscle repair and growth.

                        Triceps dips are an effective bodyweight exercise targeting the triceps, shoulders, and chest. They can be performed on a bench (beginner) or parallel bars (advanced). Proper nutrition is key for muscle growth and recovery. Consume high-protein foods like lean meats, eggs, and legumes to aid muscle repair. Carbohydrates from whole grains and fruits provide energy, while healthy fats from nuts and fish support hormonal balance. Stay hydrated and include electrolytes to prevent fatigue. Supplements like whey protein, creatine, and BCAAs can enhance performance. Eat a balanced post-workout meal within an hour and prioritize rest and recovery for optimal results.
